# apollo-federation

## What do?

The most basic implementation of Apollo Federation that I could think of to demonstrate what it does. This creates 2 services one for "hello" one for "goodbye" and a gateway that merges them. After starting all 3 you can navigate to localhost:4000/graphql and use either service. Apollo Federation can take as many services as you'd like and combine it to one single schema. 

## How do?

```
yarn install
```
When that finishes
```
yarn install-all
```
When that fiishes
```
yarn start
````
